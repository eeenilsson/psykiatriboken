## Diagnostic Criteria

A. A problematic pattern of use of an intoxicating substance not able to be classified within the alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogen (phencyclidine and others); inhalant; opioid; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; stimulant; or tobacco categories and leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use of the substance.

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects.

4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.

5. Recurrent use of the substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6. Continued use of the substance despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of its use.

7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of use of the substance.

8. Recurrent use of the substance in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

9. Use of the substance is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect.b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for other (or unknown) substance (refer to 

Criteria A and B of the criteria sets for other [or unknown] substance withdrawal, p. 583).b. The substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Specify if:

In early remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,” may be met).

In sustained remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,” may be met).

Specify if:

In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to the substance is restricted.

Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or another other (or unknown) substance-induced mental disorder is present, do not use the codes below for other (or unknown) substance use disorder. Instead, the comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the other (or unknown) substance-induced disorder code (see the coding note for other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, or specific other (or unknown) substance-induced mental disorder). 

For example, if there is comotbid other (or unknown) substance-induced depressive disorder and other (or unknown) substance use disorder, only the other (or unknown) substance- induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: FI 9.14 for other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown) substance-induced depressive disorder or FI 9.24 for a moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown) substance-induced depressive disorder.

Specify current severity:

305.90 (F I 9.10) Mild: Presence of 2 -3  symptoms.

304.90 (F I 9.20) Moderate: Presence of 4-5 symptoms.

304.90 (F19.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers"In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

## Diagnostic Features

The diagnostic dass other (or unknown) substance use and related disorders comprises substance-related disorders unrelated to alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (phencyclidine and others); inhalants; opioids; sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants 

(including amphetamine and cocaine); or tobacco. Such substances include anabolic steroids; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cortisol; antiparkinsonian medications; antihistamines; nitrous oxide; amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrites; betel nut, which is chewed in many cultures to produce mild euphoria and a floating sensation; kava (from a South 

Pacific pepper plant), which produces sedation, incoordination, weight loss, mild hepatitis, and lung abnormalities; or cathinones (including khât plant agents and synthetic chemical derivatives) that produce stimulant effects. Unknown substance-related disorders are associated with unidentified substances, such as intoxications in which the individual cannot identify the ingested drug, or substance use disorders involving either new, black market drugs not yet identified or familiar drugs illegally sold under false names.

Other (or unknown) substance use disorder is a mental disorder in which repeated use of an other or unknown substance typically continues, despite the individual's knowing that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual. Those problems are reflected in the diagnostic criteria. When the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., nitrous oxide use disorder).

## Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A diagnosis of other (or unknown) substance use disorder is supported by the individual's statement that the substance involved is not among the nine classes listed in this chapter; by recurring episodes of intoxication with negative results in standard drug screens (which may not detect new or rarely used substances); or by the presence of symptoms characteristic of an unidentified substance that has newly appeared in the individual's community.

Because of increased access to nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"), membership in certain populations is associated with diagnosis of nitrous oxide use disorder. The role of this gas as an anesthetic agent leads to misuse by some medical and dental professionals. Its use as a propellant for commercial products (e.g., whipped cream dispensers) contributes to misuse by food service workers. With recent widespread availability of the substance in "whippet" cartridges for use in home whipped cream dispensers, nitrous oxide misuse by adolescents and young adults is significant, especially among those who also inhale volatile hydrocarbons. Some continuously using individuals, inhaling from as many as 240 whippets per day, may present with serious medical complications and mental conditions, including myeloneuropathy, spinal cord subacute combined degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, and psychosis. These conditions are also associated with a diagnosis of nitrous oxide use disorder.

Use of amyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl nitrite gases has been observed among homosexual men and some adolescents, especially those with conduct disorder. Membership in these populations may be associated with a diagnosis of amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrite use disorder. However, it has not been determined that these substances produce a substance use disorder. Despite tolerance, these gases may not alter behavior through central effects, and they may be used only for their peripheral effects.

Substance use disorders generally are associated with elevated risks of suicide, but there is no evidence of unique risk factors for suicide with other (or unknown) substance use disorder.

## Prevaience

Based on extremely limited data, the prevalence of other (or unknown) substance use disorder is likely lower than that of use disorders involving the nine substance classes in this chapter.

## Development and Course

No single pattern of development or course characterizes the pharmacologically varied other (or unknown) substance use disorders. Often unknown substance use disorders will be reclassified when the unknown substance eventually is identified.

## Risk and Prognostic Factors

Risk and prognostic factors for other (or unknown) substance use disorders are thought to be similar to those for most substance use disorders and include the presence of any other substance use disorders, conduct disorder, or antisocial personality disorder in the individual or the individual's family; early onset of substance problems; easy availability of the substance in the individual's environment; childhood maltreatment or trauma; and evidence of limited early self-control and behavioral disinhibition.

Cuiture-Reiated Diagnostic issues

Certain cultures may be associated with other (or unknown) substance use disorders involving specific indigenous substances within the cultural region, such as betel nut.

## Diagnostic iViaricers

Urine, breath, or saliva tests may correctly identify a commonly used substance falsely sold as a novel product. However, routine clinical tests usually cannot identify truly unusual or new substances, which may require testing in specialized laboratories.

## Differential Diagnosis

Use of Other or unknown substances without meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder. Use of unknown substances is not rare among adolescents, but most use does not meet the diagnostic standard of two or more criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder in the past year.

Substance use disorders. Other (or unknown) substance use disorder may co-occur with various substance use disorders, and the symptoms of the disorders may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when some of the substances were not being used.

Other (or unknown) substance/medication-induced disorder. This diagnosis should be differentiated from instances when the individual's symptoms meet full criteria for one of the following disorders, and that disorder is caused by an other or unknown substance: delirium, major or mild neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, or sleep disorder.

Other medical conditions. Individuals with substance use disorders, including other 

(or unknown) substance use disorder, may present with symptoms of many medical disorders. These disorders also may occur in the absence of other (or unknown) substance use disorder. A history of little or no use of other or unknown substances helps to exclude other (or unknown) substance use disorder as the source of these problems.

## Comorbidity

Substance use disorders, including other (or unknown) substance use disorder, are commonly comorbid with one another, with adolescent conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder, and with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.

Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication 

## Diagnostic Criteria

A. The development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome attributable to recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance that is not listed elsewhere or is unknown.

B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes that are attributable to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor coordination, psychomotor agitation or retardation, euphoria, anxiety, belligerence, mood lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) and develop during, or shortly after, use of the substance.

C. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance.

Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder involving the same substance. If a mild other (or unknown) substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is FI 9.129, and if a moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is FI 9.229. If there is no comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder involving the same substance, then the ICD-10-CM code is F19.929.

Note: For information on Risk and Prognostic Factors, Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, and Diagnostic Markers, see the corresponding sections in other (or unknown) substance use disorder.

## Diagnostic Features

Other (or unknown) substance intoxication is a clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or immediately after, use of either a) a substance not elsewhere addressed in this chapter (i.e., alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; phencyclidine and other hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or b) an unknown substance. If the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding.

Application of the diagnostic criteria for other (or unknown) substance intoxication is very challenging. Criterion A requires development of a reversible "substance-specific syndrome," but if the substance is unknown, that syndrome usually will be unknown. To resolve this conflict, clinicians may ask the individual or obtain collateral history as to whether the individual has experienced a similar episode after using substances with the same "street" name or from the same source. Similarly, hospital emergency departments sometimes recognize over a few days numerous presentations of a severe, unfamiliar intoxication syndrome from a newly available, previously unknown substance. Because of the great variety of intoxicating substances. Criterion B can provide only broad examples of signs and symptoms from some intoxications, with no threshold for the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis; clinical judgment guides those decisions. Criterion C requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, or intoxications.

## Prevalence

The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance intoxication is unknown.

## Development and Course

Intoxications usually appear and then peak minutes to hours after use of the substance, but the onset and course vary with the substance and the route of administration. Generally,substances used by pulmonary inhalation and intravenous injection have the most rapid onset of action, while those ingested by mouth and requiring metabolism to an active product are much slower. (For example, after ingestion of certain mushrooms, the first signs of an eventually fatal intoxication may not appear for a few days.) Intoxication effects usually resolve within hours to a very few days. However, the body may completely eliminate an anesthetic gas such as nitrous oxide just minutes after use ends. At the other extreme, some "hit-and-run" intoxicating substances poison systems, leaving permanent impairments. For example, MPTP (l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a contaminating by-product in the synthesis of a certain opioid, kills dopaminergic cells and induces permanent parkinsonism in users who sought opioid intoxication.

## Functional Consequences of 

Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication

Impairment from intoxication with any substance may have serious consequences, including dysfunction at work, social indiscretions, problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behaviors (i.e., having unprotected sex), and substance or medication overdose. The pattern of consequences will vary with the particular substance.

## Differential Diagnosis

Use of Other or unknown substance, without meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance intoxication. The individual used an other or unknown substance(s), but the dose was insufficient to produce symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria required for the diagnosis.

Substance intoxication or other substance/medication-induced disorders. Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may experience intoxication from those substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself may help to identify it.

Different types of other (or unknown) substance-related disorders. Episodes of other 

(or unknown) substance intoxication may occur during, but are distinct from, other (or unknown) substance use disorder, unspecified other (or unknown) substance-related disorder, and other (or unknown) substance-induced disorders.

Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain function and cognition. Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of intoxications, including the examples in Criterion B. Paradoxically, drug withdrawals also must be ruled out, because, for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another drug.

## Comorbidity

As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders tend to co-occur with other (or unknown) substance intoxication.

Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal

Diagnostic Criteria 292.0 (F19.239)

A. Cessation of (or reduction in) use of a substance that has been heavy and prolonged.

B. The development of a substance-specific syndrome shortly after the cessation of (or reduction in) substance use.

C. The substance-specific syndrome causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including withdrawal from another substance.

E. The substance involved cannot be classified under any of the other substance categories (alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or is unknown.

Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is F19.239. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.

Note: For information on Risk and Prognostic Factors and Diagnostic Markers, see the corresponding sections in other (or unknown) substance use disorder.

## Diagnostic Features

Other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is a clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or within a few hours to days after, reducing or terminating dosing with a substance (Criteria A and B). Although recent dose reduction or termination usually is clear in the history, other diagnostic procedures are very challenging if the drug is unknown. Criterion B requires development of a "substance-specific syndrome" (i.e., the individual's signs and symptoms must correspond with the known withdrawal syndrome for the recently stopped drug)—a requirement that rarely can be met with an unknown substance. Consequently, clinical judgment must guide such decisions when information is this limited. Criterion D requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, or withdrawals from familiar substances. When the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., betel nut withdrawal).

## Prevaience

The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is unknown.

## Deveiopment and Course

Withdrawal signs commonly appear some hours after use of the substance is terminated, but the onset and course vary greatly, depending on the dose typically used by the person and the rate of elimination of the specific substance from the body. At peak severity, withdrawal symptoms from some substances involve only moderate levels of discomfort, whereas withdrawal from other substances may be fatal. Withdrawal-associated dysphoria often motivates relapse to substance use. Withdrawal symptoms slowly abate over days, weeks, or months, depending on the particular drug and doses to which the individual became tolerant.

Cuiture-Reiated Diagnostic issues

Culture-related issues in diagnosis will vary with the particular substance.

## Functional Consequences of 

Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal

Withdrawal from any substance may have serious consequences, including physical signs and symptoms (e.g., malaise, vital sign changes, abdominal distress, headache), intense drug craving, anxiety, depression, agitation, psychotic symptoms, or cognitive impairments. 

These consequences may lead to problems such as dysfunction at work, problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, highrisk behavior (e.g., having unprotected sex), suicide attempts, and substance or medication overdose. The pattern of consequences will vary with the particular substance.

## Differential Diagnosis

Dose reduction after extended dosing, but not meeting the criteria for other (or unknown) substance withdrawal. The individual used other (or unknown) substances, but the dose that was used was insufficient to produce symptoms that meet the criteria required for the diagnosis.

Substance withdrawal or other substance/medication-induced disorders. Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may experience withdrawal when discontinuing those substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself may help to identify it.

Different types of other (or unknown) substance-related disorders. Episodes of other 

(or unknown) substance withdrawal may occur during, but are distinct from, other (or unknown) substance use disorder, unspecified other (or unknown) substance-related disorder, and unspecified other (or unknown) substance-induced disorders.

Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain function and cognition. Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of withdrawals. 

Paradoxically, drug intoxications also must be ruled out, because, for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another drug.

## Comorbidity

As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders likely co-occur with other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.

Other (or Unknown) 

Substance-Induced Disorders

Because the category of other or unknown substances is inherently ill-defined, the extent and range of induced disorders are uncertain. Nevertheless, other (or unknown) substance-induced disorders are possible and are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication- induced mental disorders in these chapters): other (or unknown) substance-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders"); other (or unknown substance-induced bipolar disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance-induced anxiety disorders ("Anxiety Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder ("Obsessive-Compulsive and 

Related Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake
