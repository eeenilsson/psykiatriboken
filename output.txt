See also pages 8 and 9 regarding dementia and its relationships with impairment, disability and handicap. 
 
 
 Some specific points for users 
 Children and adolescents 
 Blocks F80-F89 (disorders of psychological development) and F90-F98 (behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence) cover only those disorders that are specific to childhood and adolescence. A number of disorders placed in other categories can occur in persons of almost any age, and should be used for children and adolescents when required. Examples are disorders of eating (F50.-), sleeping (F51.-) and gender identity (F64.-). Some types of phobia occurring in children pose special problems for classification, as noted in the description of F93.1 (phobic anxiety disorder of childhood). 
 
 Recording more than one diagnosis 
 It is recommended that clinicians should follow the general rule of recording as many diagnoses as are necessary to cover the clinical picture. When recording more than one diagnosis, it is usually best to give one precedence over the others by specifying it as the main diagnosis, and to label any others as subsidiary or additional diagnoses. Precedence should be given to that diagnosis most relevant to the purpose for which the diagnoses are being collected; in clinical work this is often the disorder that gave rise to the consultation or contact with health services. In many cases it will be the disorder that necessitates admission to an inpatient, outpatient or day-care service. At other times, for example when reviewing the patient's whole career, the most important diagnosis may well be the "life-time" diagnosis, which could be different from the one most relevant to the immediate consultation (for instance a patient with chronic schizophrenia presenting for an episode of care because of symptoms of acute anxiety). If there is any doubt about the order in which to record several diagnoses, or the diagnostician is uncertain of the purpose for which information will be used, a useful rule is to record the diagnoses in the numerical order in which they appear in the classification. 
 
 Recording diagnoses from other chapters of ICD-10 
 The use of other chapters of the ICD-10 system in addition to Chapter V(F) is strongly recommended. The categories most relevant to mental health services are listed in the Annex to this book.
