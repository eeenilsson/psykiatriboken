199.5 (the original and, to many,
still the best)
186.2 (competing for the crown
with enthusiasm – generally
preferred in more recent studies)
133.0 (currently the most frequently
used self-rating scale, equally good
for anxiety)
83.2 (derived from the
Comprehensive Psychopathological
Rating Scale (CPRS) and may be
of special value when multiple
pathology is being assessed; very
often used in short-term studies of
interventions, particularly drugs)
78.9 (the original self-rating scale;
still widely used)
71.9 (clear preference for this scale
in studies of older adults)
38.9 (very frequently used in
studies of suicide)
33.1 (the established scale
for assessing depression in
relationship to childbirth) Also see
Cox & Holden (2003)
22.4
22 (an example of a special area in
which a general scale may not be
accurate)
21.4 (was once very widely
used but less so recently, as the
distinction between depressive
syndromes is less often required)
15.4
11.2 (the definitive life events
assessment scale – needs prior
training – listed here as the work
was primarily concerned with
depression)
8.5. (checklists used to be very
common methods of assessing
mood states but are now less often
used)
