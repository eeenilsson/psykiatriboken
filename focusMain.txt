##c Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention

##i Introduction to Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention

This discussion covers other conditions and problems that may be a focus of clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the diagnosis, course, prognosis, or treatment of a patient's mental disorder. These conditions are presented with their corresponding codes from ICD-9-CM (usually V codes) and ICD-IO-CM (usually Z codes). A condition or problem in this chapter may be coded if it is a reason for the current visit or helps to explain the need for a test, procedure, or treatment. Conditions and problems in this chapter may also be included in the medical record as useful information on circumstances that may affect the patient's care, regardless of their relevance to the current visit.

The conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders. Their inclusion in DSM-5 is meant to draw attention to the scope of additional issues that may be encountered in routine clinical practice and to provide a systematic listing that may be useful to clinicians in documenting these issues.

##g Relational Problems <--@GROUP-->

Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner relationships and parent/caregiver- child relationships, have a significant impact on the health of the individuals in these relationships. These relationships can be health promoting and protective, neutral, or detrimental to health outcomes. In the extreme, these close relationships can be associated with maltreatment or neglect, which has significant medical and psychological consequences for the affected individual. A relational problem may come to clinical attention either as the reason that the individual seeks health care or as a problem that affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual's mental or other medical disorder.

##h Problems Related to Family Upbringing <--@HEADER-->

V61.20 (Z62.820) Parent-Child Relational Problem For this category, the term parent is used to refer to one of the child's primary caregivers, who may be a biological, adoptive, or foster parent or may be another relative (such as a grandparent) who fulfills a parental role for the child. This category should be used when the main focus of clinical attention is to address the quality of the parent-child relationship or when the quality of the parent-child relationship is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Typically, the parent-child relational problem is associated with impaired functioning in behavioral, cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral problems include inadequate parental control, supervision, and involvement with the child; parental overprotection; excessive parental pressure; arguments that escalate to threats of physical violence; and avoidance without resolution of problems. Cognitive problems may include negative attributions of the other's intentions, hostility toward or scapegoating of the other, and unwarranted feelings of estrangement.

Affective problems may include feelings of sadness, apathy, or anger about the other individual in the relationship. Clinicians should take into account the developmental needs of the child and the cultural context.

V61.8 (Z62.891 ) Sibling Relational Problem This category should be used when the focus of clinical attention is a pattern of interaction among siblings that is associated with significant impairment in individual or family functioning or with development of symptoms in one or more of the siblings, or when a sibling relational problem is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a sibling's mental or other medical disorder. This category can be used for either children or adults if the focus is on the sibling relationship. Siblings in this context include full, half-, step-, foster, and adopted siblings.

V61.8 (Z62.29) Upbringing Away From Parents This category should be used when the main focus of clinical attention pertains to issues regarding a child being raised away from the parents or when this separate upbringing affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. The child could be one who is under state custody and placed in kin care or foster care. The child could also be one who is living in a nonparental relative's home, or with friends, but whose out-of-home placement is not mandated or sanctioned by the courts. Problems related to a child living in a group home or orphanage are also included. This category excludes issues related to V60.6 (Z59.3) children in boarding schools.

V61.29 (Z62.898) Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress This category should be used when the focus of clinical attention is the negative effects of parental relationship discord (e.g., high levels of conflict, distress, or disparagement) on a child in the family, including effects on the child's mental or other medical disorders.other Problems Related to Primary Support Group V61.10 (Z63.0) Relationship Distress With Spouse or Intimate Partner This category should be used when the major focus of the clinical contact is to address the quality of the intimate (spouse or partner) relationship or when the quality of that relationship is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Partners can be of the same or different genders. Typically, the relationship distress is associated with impaired functioning in behavioral, cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral problems include conflict resolution difficulty, withdrawal, and overinvolvement. Cognitive problems can manifest as chronic negative attributions of the other's intentions or dismissals of the partner's positive behaviors. Affective problems would include chronic sadness, apathy, and/or anger about the other partner.

Note: This category excludes clinical encounters for V61.1x (Z69.1x) mental health services for spousal or partner abuse problems and V65.49 (Z70.9) sex counseling.

V61.03 (Z63.5) Disruption of Family by Separation or Divorce This category should be used when partners in an intimate adult couple are living apart due to relationship problems or are in the process of divorce.

V61.8 (Z63.8) High Expressed Emotion Level Withn Family Expressed emotion is a construct used as a qualitative measure of the "amount" of emotion—in particular, hostility, emotional overinvolvement, and criticism directed toward a family member who is an identified patient—displayed in the family environment. This category should be used when a family's high level of expressed emotion is the focus of clinical attention or is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a family member's mental or other medical disorder.

V62.82 (Z63.4) Uncomplicated Bereavement This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is a normal reaction to the death of a loved one. As part of their reaction to such a loss, some grieving individuals present with symptoms characteristic of a major depressive episode—for example, feelings of sadness and associated symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss. The berea>(ed individual typically regards the depressed mood as "normal", although the individual may seek professional help for relief of associated symptoms such as insomnia or anorexia. The duration and expression of "normal" bereavement vary considerably among different cultural groups. Further guidance in distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode is provided in the criteria for major depressive episode.

##g Abuse and Neglect <--@GROUP-->

Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver, intimate adult partner) or by a nonrelative can be the area of current clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an important factor in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other medical disorders.

Because of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care should be used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes. Having a past history of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and treatment response in a number of mental disorders, and may also be noted along with the diagnosis.

For the following categories, in addition to listings of the confirmed or suspected event of abuse or neglect, other codes are provided for use if the current clinical encounter is to provide mental health services to either the victim or the perpetrator of the abuse or neglect. A separate code is also provided for designating a past history of abuse or neglect.

## Coding Note for ICD-IO-CM Abuse and Neglect Conditions

For T codes only, the 7th character should be coded as follows:

A (initial encounter)—Use while the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition (e.g., surgical treatment, emergency department encounter, evaluation and treatment by a new clinician); or D (subsequent encounter)—Use for encounters after the patient has received active treatment for the condition and when he or she is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase (e.g., cast change or removal, removal of external or internal fixation device, medication adjustment, other aftercare and follow-up visits).

##d Child physical abuse <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

Child physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a child— r̂anging from minor bruises to severe fractures or death—occurring as a result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or other object), burning, or any other method that is inflicted by a parent, caregiver, or other individual who has responsibility for the child. Such injury is considered abuse regardless of whether the caregiver intended to hurt the child. Physical discipline, such as spanking or paddling, is not considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes no bodily injury to the child.

V65.2 (Z76.5) Malingering The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, evading criminal prosecution, or obtaining drugs. Under some circumstances, malingering may represent adaptive behavior—for example, feigning illness while a captive of the enemy during wartime. Malingering should be strongly suspected if any combination of the following is noted:

1. Medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the individual is referred by an attorney to the clinician for examination, or the individual self-refers while litigation or criminal charges are pending).

2. Marked discrepancy between the individual's claimed stress or disability and the objective findings and observations.

3. Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with the prescribed treatment regimen.

4. The presence of antisocial personality disorder.

Malingering differs from factitious disorder in that the motivation for the symptom production in malingering is an external incentive, whereas in factitious disorder external incentives are absent. Malingering is differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic symptom-related mental disorders by the intentional production of symptoms and by the obvious external incentives associated with it. Definite evidence of feigning (such as clear evidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not at home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual's apparent aim is to assume the sick role, or malingering if it is to obtain an incentive, such as money.

V40.31 (Z91.83) Wandering Associated With a Mental Disorder This category is used for individuals with a mental disorder whose desire to walk about leads to significant clinical management or safety concerns. For example, individuals with major neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental disorders may experience a restless urge to wander that places them at risk for falls and causes them to leave supervised settings without needed accompaniment. This category excludes individuals whose intent is to escape an unwanted housing situation (e.g., children who are running away from home, patients who no longer wish to remain in the hospital) or those who walk or pace as a result of medication-induced akathisia.

Coding note: First code associated mental disorder (e.g., major neurocognitive disorder, autism spectrum disorder), then code V40.31 (Z91.83) wandering associated with [specific mental disorder].

V62.89 (R41.83) Borderline Intellectual Functioning This category can be used when an individual's borderline intellectual functioning is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the individual's treatment or prognosis. Differentiating borderline intellectual functioning and mild intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) requires careful assessment of intellectual and adaptive functions and their discrepancies, particularly in the presence of co-occurring mental disorders that may affect patient compliance with standardized testing procedures (e.g., schizophrenia or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with severe impulsivity).
