##c Paraphilic Disorders

##i Introduction to Paraphilic Disorders

Paraphilic disorders included in this manual are voyeuristic disorder (spying on others in private activities), exhibitionistic disorder (exposing the genitals), frotteuristic disorder (touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual), sexual masochism disorder (undergoing humiliation, bondage, or suffering), sexual sadism disorder (inflicting humiliation, bondage, or suffering), pedophilic disorder (sexual focus on children), fe- tishistic disorder (using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts), and transvestic disorder (engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing).

These disorders have traditionally been selected for specific listing and assignment of explicit diagnostic criteria in DSM for two main reasons: they are relatively common, in relation to other paraphilic disorders, and some of them entail actions for their satisfaction that, because of their noxiousness or potential harm to others, are classed as criminal offenses. The eight listed disorders do not exhaust the list of possible paraphilic disorders.

Many dozens of distinct paraphilias have been identified and named, and almost any of them could, by virtue of its negative consequences for the individual or for others, rise to the level of a paraphilic disorder. The diagnoses of the other specified and unspecified paraphilic disorders are therefore indispensable and will be required in many cases.

In this chapter, the order of presentation of the listed paraphilic disorders generally corresponds to common classification schemes for these conditions. The first group of disorders is based on anomalous activity preferences. These disorders are subdivided into courtship disorders, which resemble distorted components of human courtship behavior (voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic disorder, and frotteuristic disorder), and algolagnie disorders, which involve pain and suffering (sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism disorder). The second group of disorders is based on anomalous target preferences. These disorders include one directed at other humans (pedophilic disorder) and two directed elsewhere (fetishistic disorder and transvestic disorder).

The term paraphilia denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners. In some circumstances, the criteria "intense and persistent" may be difficult to apply, such as in the assessment of persons who are very old or medically ill and who may not have "intense" sexual interests of any kind. In such circumstances, the term paraphilia may be defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic sexual interests. There are also specific paraphilias that are generally better described as preferential sexual interests than as intense sexual interests.

Some paraphilias primarily concern the individual's erotic activities, and others primarily concern the individual's erotic targets. Examples of the former would include intense and persistent interests in spanking, whipping, cutting, binding, or strangulating another person, or an interest in these activities that equals or exceeds the individual's interest in copulation or equivalent interaction with another person. Examples of the latter would include intense or preferential sexual interest in children, corpses, or amputees (as a class), as well as intense or preferential interest in nonhuman animals, such as horses or dogs, or in inanimate objects, such as shoes or articles made of rubber.

A paraphilic disorder is a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, toothers. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clinical intervention.

In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic disorders. Criterion A specifies the qualitative nature of the paraphilia (e.g., an erotic focus on children or on exposing tiie genitals to strangers), and Criterion B specifies the negative consequences of the paraphilia (i.e., distress, impairment, or harm to others). In keeping with the distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders, the term diagnosis should be reserved for individuals who meet both Criteria A and B (i.e., individuals who have a paraphilic disorder). If an individual meets Criterion A but not Criterion B for a particular paraphilia—a circumstance that might arise when a benign paraphilia is discovered during the clinical investigation of some other condition— then the individual may be said to have that paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder.

It is not rare for an individual to manifest two or more paraphilias. In some cases, the paraphilic foci are closely related and the connection between the paraphilias is intuitively comprehensible (e.g., foot fetishism and shoe fetishism). In other cases, the connection between the paraphilias is not obvious, and the presence of multiple paraphilias may be coincidental or else related to some generalized vulnerability to anomalies of psychosexual development. In any event, comorbid diagnoses of separate paraphilic disorders may be warranted if more than one paraphilia is causing suffering to the individual or harm to others.

Because of the two-pronged nature of diagnosing paraphilic disorders, clinician-rated or self-rated measures and severity assessments could address either the strength of the paraphilia itself or the seriousness of its consequences. Although the distress and impairment stipulated in the Criterion B are special in being the immediate or ultimate result of the paraphilia and not primarily the result of some other factor, the phenomena of reactive depression, anxiety, guilt, poor work history, impaired social relations, and so on are not unique in themselves and may be quantified with multipurpose measures of psychosocial functioning or quality of life.

The most widely applicable framework for assessing the strength of a paraphilia itself is one in which examinees' paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors are evaluated in relation to their normophilic sexual interests and behaviors. In a clinical interview or on self-administered questionnaires, examinees can be asked whether their paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors are weaker than, approximately equal to, or stronger than their normophilic sexual interests and behaviors. This same type of comparison can be, and usually is, employed in psychophysiological measures of sexual interest, such as penile plethysmography in males or viewing time in males and females.

##d Voyeuristic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.82 (F65.3)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

0. The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is at least 18 years of age.

Specify if:

In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in voyeuristic behavior are restricted.

In full remission: The individual lias not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Specifiers <--@HEADER-->

The "in full remission" specifier does not address the continued presence or absence of voyeurism per se, which may still be present after behaviors and distress have remitted.

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilic interest and to those who categorically deny any sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report distress or psychosocial problems because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences, they could be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if they declare no distress, demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of tids sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having voyeuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder.

Nondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to have been spying repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual activity on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior, and who may report that known episodes of watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of observing unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons but contest any significant or sustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about watching others nude or involved in sexual activity, it follows that they would also reject feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior constitutes sufficient support for voyeurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B)."Recurrent" spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual activity (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of watching the same victim or if there is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential interest in secret watching of naked or sexually active unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; the criteria may also be met if the individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual interest.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of voyeurism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active others is not merely transient.

Adolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate the risk of pathologizing normative sexual interest and behavior during pubertal adolescence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C).

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

Voyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual behaviors. The population prevalence of voyeuristic disorder is unknown. However, based on voyeuristic sexual acts in nonclinical samples, the highest possible lifetime prevalence for voyeuristic disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4% in females.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Adult males with voyeuristic disorder often first become aware of their sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting persons during adolescence. However, the minimum age for a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years because there is substantial difficulty in differentiating it from age-appropriate puberty-related sexual curiosity and activity. The persistence of voyeurism over time is unclear. Voyeuristic disorder, however, per definition requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons. Therefore, the course of voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary with age.

##h Risk and Prognostic Factors <--@HEADER-->

Iemperamental. Voyeurism is a necessary precondition for voyeuristic disorder; hence, risk factors for voyeurism should also increase the rate of voyeuristic disorder.

Environmental. Childhood sexual abuse, substance misuse, and sexual preoccupation/ hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors, although the causal relationship to voyeurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear.

##h Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues <--@HEADER-->

Voyeuristic disorder is very uncommon among females in clinical settings, while the male- to-female ratio for single sexually arousing voyeuristic acts might be 3:1.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting others who are naked or engaging in sexual activity should be lacking.

Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders might involve single voyeuristic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting persons being naked or engaging in sexual activity. Hence, recurrent voyeuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that voyeuristic disorder might be present.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Known comorbidities in voyeuristic disorder are largely based on research with males suspected of or convicted for acts involving the secret watching of unsuspecting nude or sexually active persons. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals with voyeuristic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with voyeuristic disorder include hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder. Depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder are also frequent co- morbid conditions.

##d Exhibitionistic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.4 (F65.2)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify whether:

## Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children

## Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature individuals

## Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children and to physically mature individuals

_Specify_ if; In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to expose one’s genitals are restricted.

In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Subtypes <--@HEADER-->

The subtypes for exhibitionistic disorder are based on the age or physical maturity of the nonconsenting individuals to whom the individual prefers to expose his or her genitals. The nonconsenting individuals could be prepubescent children, adults, or both. This specifier should help draw adequate attention to characteristics of victims of individuals with exhibitionistic disorder to prevent co-occurring pedophilic disorder from being overlooked. However, indications that the individual with exhibitionistic disorder is sexually attracted to exposing his or her genitals to children should not preclude a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder.

##h Specifiers <--@HEADER-->

The "in full remission" specifier does not address the continued presence or absence of exhibitionism per se, which may still be present after behaviors and distress have remitted.

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnostic criteria for exhibitionistic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who categorically deny any sexual attraction to exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for exposing, they may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (exemplified by absence of anxiety, obsessions, and guilt or shame about these paraphilic impulses) and are not impaired by this sexual interest in other important areas of functioning, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them, they could be ascertained as having exhibitionistic sexual interest but not be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder.

Examples of nondisclosing individuals include those who have exposed themselves repeatedly to unsuspecting persons on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual behavior and who report that known episodes of exposure were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of sexual behavior involving genital exposure but refute any significant or sustained sexual interest in such behavior. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving genital exposure, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder despite their negative self-report. Recurrent exhibitionistic behavior constitutes sufficient support for exhibitionism (Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (Criterion B)."Recurrent" genital exposure to unsuspecting others (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of exposure to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in genital exposure to unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as criteria may be met by an individual's acknowledging intense exhibitionistic sexual interest with distress and/or impairment.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of exhibitionism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in exposing one's genitals to unsuspecting others is not merely transient. This might be expressed in clear evidence of repeated behaviors or distress over a nontransient period shorter than 6 months.

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown. However, based on exhibitionistic sexual acts in nonclinical or general populations, the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in the male population is 2%-4%. The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder in females is even more uncertain but is generally believed to be much lower than in males.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Adult males with exhibitionistic disorder often report that they first became aware of sexual interest in exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons during adolescence, at a somewhat later time than the typical development of normative sexual interest in women or men. Although there is no minimum age requirement for the diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder, it may be difficult to differentiate exhibitionistic behaviors from age-appropriate sexual curiosity in adolescents. Whereas exhibitionistic impulses appear to emerge in adolescence or early adulthood, very little is known about persistence over time. By definition, exhibitionistic disorder requires one or more contributing factors, which may change over time with or without treatment; subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), mental disorder comorbidity, hypersexuality, and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Therefore, the course of exhibitionistic disorder is likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated with decreasing exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior.

##h Risk and Prognostic Factors <--@HEADER-->

Temperamental. Since exhibitionism is a necessary precondition for exhibitionistic disorder, risk factors for exhibitionism should also increase the rate of exhibitionistic disorder. Antisocial history, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol misuse, and pedophilic sexual preference might increase risk of sexual recidivism in exhibitionistic offenders.

Hence, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol use disorder, and pedophilic interest may be considered ri^k factors for exhibitionistic disorder in males with exhibitionistic sexual preferences.

Environmental. Childhood sexual and emotional abuse and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors for exhibitionism, although the causal relationship to exhibitionism is uncertain and the specificity unclear.

##h Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues <--@HEADER-->

Exhibitionistic disorder is highly unusual in females, whereas single sexually arousing exhibitionistic acts might occur up to half as often among women compared with men.

##h Functional Consequences of Exiiibitionistic Disorder <--@HEADER-->

The functional consequences of exhibitionistic disorder have not been addressed in research involving individuals who have not acted out sexually by exposing their genitals to unsuspecting strangers but who fulfill Criterion B by experiencing intense emotional distress over these preferences.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Potential differential diagnoses for exhibitionistic disorder sometimes occur also as co- morbid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for exhibitionistic disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions.

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in exposing the genitals should be lacking.

Substance use disorders. Alcohol and substance use disorders might involve single exhibitionistic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sexual interest in exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent exhibitionistic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that exhibitionistic disorder might be present.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Known comorbidities in exhibitionistic disorder are largely based on research with individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving genital exposure to nonconsenting individuals. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who qualify for a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with exhibitionistic disorder at high rates include depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders; hypersexuality; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; other paraphilic disorders; and antisocial personality disorder.

##d Frotteuristic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.89 (F65.81)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:

In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to touch or rub against a nonconsenting person are restricted.

In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Specifiers <--@HEADER-->

The "in remission" specifier does not address the continued presence or absence of frot- teurism per se, which may still be present after behaviors and distress have remitted.

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who relatively freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who firmly deny any sexual attraction from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual regardless of considerable objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial impairment due to their sexual preferences for touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual, they could be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame) about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having frotteuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder.

Nondisclosing individuals include, for instance, individuals known to have been touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals on separate occasions but who contest any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior. Such individuals may report that identified episodes of touching or rubbing against an unwilling individual were all unintentional and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals but contest any major or persistent sexual interest in this. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about touching or rubbing, they would consequently reject feeling distressed or psychosocially impaired by such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing position, such individuals may be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. Recurrent frotteuristic behavior constitutes satisfactory support for frotteurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and concurrently demonstrates that this paraphili- cally motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B)."Recurrent" touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be inteφreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be inteφreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of touching or rubbing against the same unwilling individual, or corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals. Note that multiple victims are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; criteria may also be met if the individual acknowledges intense frotteuristic sexual interest with clinically significant distress and/or impairment.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of frotteurism must persist for at least 6 months, should also be inteφreted as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual is not transient. Hence, the duration part of Criterion A may also be met if there is clear evidence of recurrent behaviors or distress over a shorter but nontransient time period.

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

Frotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexual touching of or rubbing against another individual, may occur in up to 30% of adult males in the general population. Approximately10%-14% of adult males seen in outpatient settings for paraphilic disorders and hypersexuality have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder. Hence, whereas the population prevalence of frotteuristic disorder is unknown, it is not likely that it exceeds the rate found in selected clinical settings.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Adult males with frotteuristic disorder often report first becoming aware of their sexual interest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging adulthood. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling others in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder. Although there is no minimum age for the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to differentiate from conduct-disordered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of frotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by definition requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity; hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by touching or rubbing against unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course of frotteuristic disorder is likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated with decreasing frotteuristic sexual preferences and behavior.

##h Risk and Prognostic Factors <--@HEADER-->

Temperamental. Nonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality might be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. However, frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic disorder, so risk factors for frotteurism should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder.

##h Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues <--@HEADER-->

There appear to be substantially fewer females with frotteuristic sexual preferences than males.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual should be lacking.

Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders, particularly those involving stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained sexual interest in touching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent frotteuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that frotteuristic disorder might be present.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Known comorbidities in frotteuristic disorder are largely based on research with males suspected of or convicted for criminal acts involving sexually motivated touching of or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to other individuals with a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual interest. Conditions that occur comorbidly with frotteuristic disorder include hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder and voyeuristic disorder. Conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, depressivedisorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders also co-occur.

Potential differential diagnoses for frotteuristic disorder sometimes occur also as comor- bid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for frotteuristic disorder and possible comorbid conditions as separate questions.

##d Sexual masochism disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.83 (F65.51)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or othenwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:

With asphyxiophilia: If the individual engages in the practice of achieving sexual arousal related to restriction of breathing.

Specify if:

In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in masochistic sexual behaviors are restricted.

In full remission: There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at last 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnostic criteria for sexual masochism disorder are intended to apply to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests. Such individuals openly acknowledge intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. If these individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, they may be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress, exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other personal goals, they could be ascertained as having masochistic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual masochism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer is not merely transient. However, the disorder can be diagnosed in the context of a clearly sustained but shorter time period.

##h Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

The extensive use of pornography involving the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer is sometimes an associated feature of sexual masochism disorder.

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

The population prevalence of sexual masochism disorder is unknown. In Australia, it has been estimated that 2.2% of males and 1.3% of females had been involved in bondage and discipline, sadomasochism, or dominance and submission in the past 12 months.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Community individuals with paraphilias have reported a mean age at onset for masochism of 19.3 years, although earlier ages, including puberty and childhood, have also been reported for the onset of masochistic fantasies. Very little is known about persistence over time. Sexual masochism disorder per definition requires one or more contributing factors, which may change over time with or without treatment. These include subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity, and psychosocial impairment. Therefore, the course of sexual masochism disorder is likely to vary with age. Advancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on sexual preference involving sexual masochism as it has on other para- philic or normophilic sexual behavior.

##h Functional Consequences of Sexual Masochism Disorder <--@HEADER-->

The functional consequences of sexual masochism disorder are unknown. However, mas- ochists are at risk of accidental death while practicing asphyxiophilia or other autoerotic procedures.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual masochism disorder (e.g., transvestic fetishism, sexual sadism disorder, hypersexuality, alcohol and substance use disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual masochism disorder, keeping the possibility of other paraphilias or other mental disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. Sexual masochism in the absence of distress (i.e., no disorder) is also included in the differential, as individuals who conduct the behaviors may be satisfied with their masochistic orientation.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Known comorbidities with sexual masochism disorder are largely based on individuals in treatment. Disorders that occur comorbidly with sexual masochism disorder typically include other paraphilic disorders, such as transvestic fetishism.

##d Sexual sadism disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.84 (F65.52)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:

In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in sadistic sexual behaviors are restricted.

In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests and to those who deny any sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Individuals who openly acknowledge intense sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of others are referred to as "admitting individuals." If these individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for the physical or psychological suffering of another individual, they may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no distress, exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other goals, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them, then they could be ascertained as having sadistic sexual interest but they would not meet criteria for sexual sadism disorder.

Examples of individuals who deny any interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual include individuals known to have inflicted pain or suffering on multiple victims on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual behavior and who may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were either unintentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past episodes of sexual behavior involving the infliction of pain or suffering on a nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant or sustained sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual.

Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving sexual arousal to pain and suffering, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder despite their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior constitutes clinical support for the presence of the paraphilia of sexual sadism (by satisfying Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that their paraphilically motivated behavior is causing clinically significant distress, harm, or risk of harm to others (satisfying Criterion B)."Recurrent" sexual sadism involving nonconsenting others (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion, if there are multiple instances of infliction of pain and suffering to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in pain and suffering involving multiple victims. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as the criteria may be met if the individual acknowledges intense sadistic sexual interest.

The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual sadism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and suffering on nonconsenting victims is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be met if there is a clearly sustained but shorter period of sadistic behaviors.

##h Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

The extensive use of pornography involving the infliction of pain and suffering is sometimes an associated feature of sexual sadism disorder.

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

The population prevalence of sexual sadism disorder is unknown and is largely based on individuals in forensic settings. Depending on the criteria for sexual sadism, prevalence varies widely, from 2% to 30%. Among civilly committed sexual offenders in the United States, less than 10% have sexual sadism. Among individuals who have committed sexually motivated homicides, rates of sexual sadism disorder range from 37% to 75%.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Individuals with sexual sadism in forensic samples are almost exclusively male, but a representative sample of the population in Australia reported that 2.2% of men and 1.3% of women said they had been involved in bondage and discipline, "sadomasochism", or dominance and submission in the previous year. Information on the development and course of sexual sadism disorder is extremely limited. One study reported that females became aware of their sadomasochistic orientation as young adults, and another reported that the mean age at onset of sadism in a group of males was 19.4 years. Whereas sexual sadism per se is probably a lifelong characteristic, sexual sadism disorder may fluctuate according to the individual's subjective distress or his or her propensity to harm nonconsenting others.

Advancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on this disorder as it has on other paraphilic or normophilic sexual behavior.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual sadism disorder (e.g., antisocial personality disorder, sexual masochism disorder, hypersexuality, substance use disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual sadism disorder, keeping the possibility of other paraphilias or mental disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. The majority of individuals who are active in community networks that practice sadistic and masochistic behaviors do not express any dissatisfaction with their sexual interests, and their behavior would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual sadism disorder. Sadistic interest, but not the disorder, may be considered in the differential diagnosis.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Known comorbidities with sexual sadism disorder are largely based on individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving sadistic acts against nonconsenting victims. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who never engaged in sadistic activity with a nonconsenting victim but who qualify for a diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual interest. Disorders that are commonly comorbid with sexual sadism disorder include other paraphilic disorders.

##d Pedophilic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.2 (F65.4)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger).

B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.

C. The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A.

Note: Do not include an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.

Specify whether:

## Exclusive type (attracted only to children)

## Nonexclusive type

Specify if:

## Sexually attracted to males

## Sexually attracted to females

## Sexually attracted to both

Specify if:

## Limited to incest

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Examples of disclosing this paraphilia include candidly acknowledging an intense sexual interest in children and indicating that sexual interest in children is greater than or equal to sexual interest in physically mature individuals. If individuals also complain that their sexual attractions or preferences for children are causing psychosocial difficulties, they may be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder. However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt, shame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited by their paraphilic impulses (according to self-report, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and legally recorded histories indicate that they have never acted on their impulses, then these individuals have a pedophilic sexual orientation but not pedophilic disorder.

Examples of individuals who deny attraction to children include individuals who are known to have sexually approached multiple children on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about sexual behavior involving children, and who may further claim that the known episodes of physical contact were all unintentional and nonsexual. Other individuals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual behavior involving children but deny any significant or sustained sexual interest in children. Since these individuals may deny experiences impulses or fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling subjectively distressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder despite the absence of self-reported distress, provided that there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for 6 months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges or experienced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence of the disorder (Criterion B).

Presence of multiple victims, as discussed above, is sufficient but not necessary for diagnosis; that is, the individual can still meet Criterion A by merely acknowledging intense or preferential sexual interest in children.

The Criterion A clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of pedophilia have persisted for 6 months or longer, is intended to ensure that the sexual attraction to children is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be made if there is clinical evidence of sustained persistence of the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month duration cannot be precisely determined.

##h Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

The extensive use of pornography depicting prepubescent children is a useful diagnostic indicator of pedophilic disorder. This is a specific instance of the general case that individuals are likely to choose the kind of pornography that corresponds to their sexual interests.

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder is unknown. The highest possible prevalence for pedophilic disorder in the male population is approximately 3%-5%. The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder in females is even more uncertain, but it is likely a small fraction of the prevalence in males.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Adult males νιψ pedophilic disorder may indicate that they become aware of strong or preferential sexual interest in children around the time of puberty—the same time frame in which males who later prefer physically mature partners became aware of their sexual interest in women or men. Attempting to diagnose pedophilic disorder at the age at which it first manifests is problematic because of the difficulty during adolescent development in differentiating it from age-appropriate sexual interest in peers or from sexual curiosity.

Hence, Criterion C requires for diagnosis a minimum age of 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A.

Pedophilia per se appears to be a lifelong condition. Pedophilic disorder, however, necessarily includes other elements that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or psychosocial impairment, or the propensity to act out sexually with children, or both.

Therefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may fluctuate, increase, or decrease with age.

Adults with pedophilic disorder may report an awareness of sexual interest in children that preceded engaging in sexual behavior involving children or self-identification as a pedophile. Advanced age is as likely to similarly diminish the frequency of sexual behavior involving children as it does other paraphilically motivated and normophilic sexual behavior.

##h Risk and Prognostic Factors <--@HEADER-->

Temperamental. There appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and antisociality, such that males with both traits are more likely to act out sexually with children. Thus, antisocial personality disorder may be considered a risk factor for pedophilic disorder in males with pedophilia.

Environmental. Adult males with pedophilia often report that they were sexually abused as children. It is unclear, however, whether this correlation reflects a causal influence of childhood sexual abuse on adult pedophilia.

Genetic and physiological. Since pedophilia is a necessary condition for pedophilic disorder, any factor that increases the probability of pedophilia also increases the risk of pedophilic disorder. There is some evidence that neurodevelopmental perturbation in utero increases the probability of development of a pedophilic orientation.

##h Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues <--@HEADER-->

Psychophysiological laboratory measures of sexual interest, which are sometimes useful in diagnosing pedophilic disorder in males, are not necessarily useful in diagnosing this disorder in females, even when an identical procedure (e.g., viewing time) or analogous procedures (e.g., penile plethysmography and vaginal photoplethysmography) are available.

##h Diagnostic Markers <--@HEADER-->

Psychophysiological measures of sexual interest may sometimes be useful when an individual's history suggests the possible presence of pedophilic disorder but the individual denies strong or preferential attraction to children. The most thoroughly researched and longest used of such measures is penile plethysmography, although the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis may vary from one site to another. Viewing time, using photographs of nude or minimally clothed persons as visual stimuli, is also used to diagnose pedophilic disorder, especially in combination with self-report measures. Mental health professionals in the United States, however, should be aware that possession of such visual stimuli, even for diagnostic purposes, may violate American law regarding possession of child pornography and leave the mental health professional susceptible to criminal prosecution.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for pedophilic disorder also sometimes occur as comorbid diagnoses. It is therefore generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for pedophilic disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions.

Antisocial personality disorder. This disorder increases the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the mature physique will approach a child, on one or a few occasions, on the basis of relative availability. The individual often shows other signs of this personality disorder, such as recurrent law-breaking.

Alcohol and substance use disorders. The disinhibiting effects of intoxication may also increase the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the mature physique will sexually approach a child.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are occasional individuals who complain about ego-dystonic thoughts and worries about possible attraction to children. Clinical interviewing usually reveals an absence of sexual thoughts about children during high states of sexual arousal (e.g., approaching orgasm during masturbation) and sometimes additional ego-dystonic, intrusive sexual ideas (e.g., concerns about homosexuality).

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Psychiatric comorbidity of pedophilic disorder includes substance use disorders; depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders; antisocial personality disorder; and other paraphilic disorders. However, findings on comorbid disorders are largely among individuals convicted for sexual offenses involving children (almost all males) and may not be general- izable to other individuals with pedophilic disorder (e.g., individuals who have never approached a child sexually but who qualify for the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder on the basis of subjective distress).

##d Fetishistic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.81 (F65.0)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body part(s), as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C. The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically designed for the puφose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g., vibrator).

Specify:

## Body part(s)

## Nonliving object(s)

## Other

Specify if:in a controiied environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in fetishistic behaviors are restricted.in fuii remission: There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Specifiers <--@HEADER-->

Although individuals with fetishistic disorder may report intense and recurrent sexual arousal to inanimate objects or a specific body part, it is not unusual for non-mutually exclusive combinations of fetishes to occur. Thus, an individual may have fetishistic disorder associated with an inanimate object (e.g., female undergarments) or an exclusive focus on an intensely eroticized body part (e.g., feet, hair), or their fetishistic interest may meet criteria for various combinations of these specifiers (e.g., socks, shoes and feet).

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and repetitive use of or dependence on nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on a (typically nongenital) body part as primary elements associated with sexual arousal (Criterion A). A diagnosis of fetishistic disorder must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial role impairment (Criterion B). Common fetish objects include female undergarments, male or female footwear, rubber articles, leather clothing, or other wearing apparel. Highly eroticized body parts associated with fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is not uncommon for sexualized fetishes to include both inanimate objects and body parts (e.g., dirty socks and feet), and for this reason the definition of fetishistic disorder now re-incorporates partialism (i.e., an exclusive focus on a body part) into its boundaries. Partialism, previously considered a paraphilia not otherwise specified disorder, had historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-ΠΙ.

Many individuals who self-identify as fetishist practitioners do not necessarily report clinical impairment in association with their fetish-associated behaviors. Such individuals could be considered as having a fetish but not fetishistic disorder. A diagnosis of fetishistic disorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the behaviors in Criterion A and the clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning noted in Criterion B.

##h Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Fetishistic disorder can be a multisensory experience, including holding, tasting, rubbing, inserting, or smelling the fetish object while masturbating, or preferring that a sexual partner wear or utilize a fetish object during sexual encounters. Some individuals may acquire extensive collections of highly desired fetish objects.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

Usually paraphilias have an onset during puberty, but fetishes can develop prior to adolescence. Once established, fetishistic disorder tends to have a continuous course that fluctuates in intensity and frequency of urges or behavior.

##h Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues <--@HEADER-->

Knowledge of and appropriate consideration for normative aspects of sexual behavior are important factors to explore to establish a clinical diagnosis of fetishistic disorder and to distinguish a clinical diagnosis from a socially acceptable sexual behavior.

##h Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues <--@HEADER-->

Fetishistic disorder has not been systematically reported to occur in females. In clinical samples, fetishistic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males.

##h Functional Consequences of Fetishistic Disorder <--@HEADER-->

Typical impairments associated with fetishistic disorder include sexual dysfunction during romantic reciprocal relationships when the preferred fetish object or body part isunavailable during foreplay or coitus. Some individuals with fetishistic disorder may prefer solitary sexual activity associated with their fetishistic preference(s) even while involved in a meaningful reciprocal and affectionate relationship.

Although fetishistic disorder is relatively uncommon among arrested sexual offenders with paraphilias, males with fetishistic disorder may steal and collect their particular fetishistic objects of desire. Such individuals have been arrested and charged for nonsexual antisocial behaviors (e.g., breaking and entering, theft, burglary) that are primarily motivated by the fetishistic disorder.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Transvestic disorder. The nearest diagnostic neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transves- tic disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when fetish objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder), or when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been designed for that purpose (e.g., a vibrator).

Sexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic disorders. Fetishes can co-occur with other paraphilic disorders, especially "sadomasochism" and transvestic disorder. When an individual fantasizes about or engages in "forced cross-dressing" and is primarily sexually aroused by the domination or humiliation associated with such fantasy or repetitive activity, the diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder should be made.

Fetishistic behavior without fetishistic disorder. Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal without any associated distress or psychosocial role impairment or other adverse consequence would not meet criteria for fetishistic disorder, as the threshold required by Criterion B would not be met. For example, an individual whose sexual partner either shares or can successfully incorporate his interest in caressing, smelling, or licking feet or toes as an important element of foreplay would not be diagnosed with fetishistic disorder; nor would an individual who prefers, and is not distressed or impaired by, solitary sexual behavior associated with wearing rubber garments or leather boots.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Fetishistic disorder may co-occur with other paraphilic disorders as well as hypersexuality. Rarely, fetishistic disorder may be associated with neurological conditions.

##d Transvestic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.3 (F65.1)

##h Diagnostic Criteria <--@HEADER-->

A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from crossdressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Specify if:

With fetishism: If sexually aroused by fabrics, materials, or garments.

With autogynephiiia: If sexually aroused by thoughts or images of self as female.

Specify if:in a controiied environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to cross-dress are restricted, in fuii remission: There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

##h Specifiers <--@HEADER-->

The presence of fetishism decreases the likelihood of gender dysphoria in men with transvestic disorder. The presence of autogynephilia increases the likelihood of gender dysphoria in men with transvestic disorder.

##h Diagnostic Features <--@HEADER-->

The diagnosis of transvestic disorder does not apply to all individuals who dress as the opposite sex, even those who do so habitually. It applies to individuals whose cross-dressing or thoughts of cross-dressing are always or often accompanied by sexual excitement (Criterion A) and who are emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel it impairs social or interpersonal functioning (Criterion B). The cross-dressing may involve only one or two articles of clothing (e.g., for men, it may pertain only to women's undergarments), or it may involve dressing completely in the iimer and outer garments of the other sex and (in men) may include the use of women's wigs and make-up. Transvestic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection, may co-occur with cross-dressing in various ways. In younger males, cross-dressing often leads to masturbation, following which any female clothing is removed. Older males often leam to avoid masturbating or doing anything to stimulate the penis so that the avoidance of ejaculation allows them to prolong their cross-dressing session. Males with female partners sometimes complete a cross-dressing session by having intercourse with their partners, and some have difficulty maintaining a sufficient erection for intercourse without cross-dressing (or private fantasies of cross-dressing).

Clinical assessment of distress or impairment, like clinical assessment of transvestic sexual arousal, is usually dependent on the individual's self-report. The pattern of behavior "purging and acquisition" often signifies the presence of distress in individuals with transvestic disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man) who has spent a great deal of money on women's clothes and other apparel (e.g., shoes, wigs) discards the items (i.e., purges them) in an effort to overcome urges to cross-dress, and then begins acquiring a woman's wardrobe all over again.

##h Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Transvestic disorder in men is often accompanied by autogynephilia (i.e., a male's para- philic tendency to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman).

Autogynephilic fantasies and behaviors may focus on the idea of exhibiting female physiological functions (e.g., lactation, menstruation), engaging in stereotypically feminine behavior (e.g., knitting), or possessing female anatomy (e.g., breasts).

##h Prevalence <--@HEADER-->

The prevalence of transvestic disorder is unknown. Transvestic disorder is rare in males and extremely rare in females. Fewer than 3% of males report having ever been sexually aroused by dressing in women's attire. The percentage of individuals who have crossdressed with sexual arousal more than once or a few times in their lifetimes would be even lower. The majority of males with transvestic disorder identify as heterosexual, although some individuals have occasional sexual interaction with other males, especially when they are cross-dressed.

##h Development and Course <--@HEADER-->

In males, the first signs of transvestic disorder may begin in childhood, in the form of strong fascination with a particular item of women's attire. Prior to puberty, cross-dressing produces generalized feelings of pleasurable excitement. With the arrival of puberty, dressing in women's clothes begins to elicit penile erection and, in some cases, leads directly to first ejaculation. In many cases, cross-dressing elicits less and less sexual excitement as the individual grows older; eventually it may produce no discernible penile response at all. The desire to cross-dress, at the same time, remains the same or grows even stronger. Individuals who report such a diminution of sexual response typically report that the sexual excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by feelings of comfort or well-being.

In some cases, the course of transvestic disorder is continuous, and in others it is episodic. It is not rare for men with transvestic disorder to lose interest in cross-dressing when they first fall in love with a woman and begin a relationship, but such abatement usually proves temporary. When the desire to cross-dress returns, so does the associated distress.

Some cases of transvestic disorder progress to gender dysphoria. The males in these cases, who may be indistinguishable from others with transvestic disorder in adolescence or early childhood, gradually develop desires to remain in the female role for longer periods and to feminize their anatomy. The development of gender dysphoria is usually accompanied by a (self-reported) reduction or elimination of sexual arousal in association with cross-dressing.

The manifestation of transvestism in penile erection and stimulation, like the manifestation of other paraphilic as well as normophiHc sexual interests, is most intense in adolescence and early adulthood. The severity of transvestic disorder is highest in adulthood, when the transvestic drives are most likely to conflict with performance in heterosexual intercourse and desires to marry and start a family. Middle-age and older men with a history of transvestism are less likely to present with transvestic disorder than with gender dysphoria.

##h Functional Consequences of Transvestic Disorder <--@HEADER-->

Engaging in transvestic behaviors can interfere with, or detract from, heterosexual relationships. This can be a source of distress to men who wish to maintain conventional marriages or romantic partnerships with women.

##h Differential Diagnosis <--@HEADER-->

Fetishistic disorder. This disorder may resemble transvestic disorder, in particular, in men with fetishism who put on women's undergarments while masturbating with them.

Distinguishing transvestic disorder depends on the individual's specific thoughts during such activity (e.g., are there any ideas of being a woman, being like a woman, or being dressed as a woman?) and on the presence of other fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether these are used for garments or for something else).

Gender dysphoria. Individuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence between their experienced gender and assigned gender nor a desire to be of the other gender; and they typically do not have a history of childhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be present in individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets fuU criteria for transvestic disorder as weU as gender dysphoria should be given both diagnoses.

##h Comorbidity <--@HEADER-->

Transvestism (and thus transvestic disorder) is often found in association with other paraphilias. The most frequently co-occurring paraphilias are fetishism and masochism. One particularly dangerous form of masochism, autoerotic asphyxia, is associated with transvestism in a substantial proportion of fatal cases.

##d Other specified paraphilic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.89 (F65.89)

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified paraphilic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific paraphilic disorder. This is done by recording “other specified paraphilic disorder'’ followed by the specific reason (e.g., “zoophilia”).

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include, but are not limited to, recurrent and intense sexual arousal involving telephone scatologia (obscene phone calls), necrophilia (coφses), zoophilia (animals), coprophilia (feces), klismaphilia (enemas), or urophilia (urine) that has been present for at least 6 months and causes marked distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Other specified paraphilic disorder can be specified as in remission and/or as occurring in a controlled environment.

##d Unspecified paraphilic disorder <--@DIAGNOSIS-->

302.9 (F65.9)

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified paraphilic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific paraphilic disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.
