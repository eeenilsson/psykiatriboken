##c Other Mental Disorders

##i Introduction to Other Mental Disorders

Four disorders are included in this chapter: other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition; unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition; other specified mental disorder; and unspecified mental disorder. This residual category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any other mental disorder in DSM-5. For other specified and unspecified mental disorders due to another medical condition, it must be established that the disturbance is caused by the physiological effects of another medical condition. If other specified and unspecified mental disorders are due to another medical condition, it is necessary to code and list the medical condition first (e.g., 042 [B20] HIV disease), followed by the other specified or unspecified mental disorder (use appropriate code).

## Due to Another Medical Condition

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to another medical condition. The other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to another medical condition. This is done by recording the name of the disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition inserted in place of “another medical condition,” followed by the specific symptomatic manifestation that does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical condition. Furthermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must be listed immediately before the code for the other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as 345.40 (G40.209), complex partial seizures 294.8 (F06.8) other specified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures, dissociative symptoms.

An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” designation is the following:

Dissociative symptoms: This includes symptoms occurring, for example, in the context of complex partial seizures.

## Due to Another Medical Condition 294.9 (F09)

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical condition.

The unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses nof to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific mental disorder due to another medical condition, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). This is done by recording the name of the disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition inserted in place of “another medical condition.” Furthermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must be listed immediately before the code for the unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as 345.40 (G40.209) complex partial seizures, 294.9 (F06.9) unspecified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures.

## Other Specified Mental Disorder

300.9 (F99)

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder. The other specified mental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder. This is done by recording “other specified mental disorder” followed by the specific reason.

## Unspecified Mental Disorder

300.9 (F99)

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any mental disorder. The unspecified mental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific mental disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).
