In contrast to mood, which refers to a pervasive and sustained emotional "climate", ajfect refers to more fluctuating changes in emotional "weather." What is considered the normal range of the expression of affect varies considerably, both within and among different cultures. Disturbances in affect includeblunted Significant reduction in the intensity of emotional expression.

*flat* Absence or near absence of any sign of affective expression.

*inappropriate* Discordance between affective expression and the content of speech or ideation.

*labile* Abnormal variability in affect with repeated, rapid, and abrupt shifts in affective expression.

*alogia* An impoverishment in thinking that is inferred from observing speech and language behavior. There may be brief and concrete replies to questions and restriction in the amount of spontaneous speech (termed poverty of speech). Sometimes the speech is adequate in amoimt but conveys little information because it is overconcrete, overabstract, repetitive, or stereotyped (termed poverty of content).amnesia An inability to recall important autobiographical information that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.

*antagonism* Behaviors that put an individual at odds with other people, such as an exaggerated sense of self-importance with a concomitant expectation of special treatment, as well as a callous antipathy toward others, encompassing both unawareness of others' needs and feelings, and a readiness to use others in the service of self-enhancement. Antagonism is one of the five broad PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders." Small caps indicate term found elsewhere in this glossary. Glossary definitions were informed by DSM-5 Work Groups, publicly available Internet sources, and previously published glossaries for mental disorders (World Health Organization and American Psychiatric Association).antidepressant discontinuation syndrome A set of symptoms that can occur after abrupt cessation, or marked reduction in dose, of an antidepressant medication that had been taken continuously for at least 1 month.

*g* ., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.

*g* ., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive.

The symptom is not fully explained by a neurological or another medical condition or the direct effects of a substance and is not intentionally produced or feigned.

*deceitfulness* Dishonesty and fraudulence; misrepresentation of self; embellishment or fabrication when relating events. Deceitfulness is a facet of the broad personality trait domain ANTAGONISM.

*defense mechanism* Mechanisms that mediate the individual's reaction to emotional conflicts and to external stressors. Some defense mechanisms (e.

*g* ., suppression, denial) may be either maladaptive or adaptive, depending on their severity, their inflexibility, and the context in which they occur.

*delusion* A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly held despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. The belief is not ordinarily accepted by other members of the person's culture or subculture (i.

*e* ., it is not an article of religious faith). When a false belief involves a value judgment, it is regarded as a delusion only when the judgment is so extreme as to defy credibility. Delusional conviction can sometimes be inferred from an overvalued idea (in which case the individual has an unreasonable belief or idea but does not hold it as firmly as is the case with a delusion). Delusions are subdivided according to their content. Common types are listed below:bizarre A delusion that involves a phenomenon that the person's culture would regard as physically impossible.

*of reference* A delusion in which events, objects, or other persons in one's immediate environment are seen as having a particular and unusual significance. These delusions are usually of a negative or pejorative nature but also may be grandiose in content. A delusion of reference differs from an idea of reference, in which the false belief is not as firmly held nor as fully organized into a true belief.

*persecutory* A delusion in which the central theme is that one (or someone to whom one is close) is being attacked, harassed, cheated, persecuted, or conspired against.

*somatic* A delusion whose main content pertains to the appearance or functioning of one's body.

*g* ., feeling like one is in a dream; a sense of unreality of self, perceptual alterations; emotional and/or physical numbing; temporal distortions; sense of unreality).depressivity Feelings of being intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless. Some patients describe an absence of feelings and/or dysphoria; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the future; pervasive shame and/or guilt; feelings of inferior self-worth; and thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.

Detachment is one of the five pathological PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section ΙΠ "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders."disinhibition Orientation toward immediate gratification, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts, feelings, and external stimuli, without regard for past learning or consideration of future consequences. RIGID PERFECTIONISM, the opposite pole of this domain, reflects excessive constraint of impulses, risk avoidance, hyperresponsibility, hyperperfectionism, and rigid, rule-governed behavior. Disinhibition is one of the five pathological PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders."disorder of sex development Condition of significant inborn somatic deviations of the reproductive tract from the norm and/or of discrepancies among the biological indicators of male and female.

*disorientation* Confusion about the time of day, date, or season (time); where one is (place); or who one is (person).dissociation The splitting off of clusters of mental contents from conscious awareness.

Dissociation is a mechanism central to dissociative disorders. The term is also used to describe the separation of an idea from its emotional significance and affect, as seen in the inappropriate affect in schizophrenia. Often a result of psychic trauma, dissociation may allow the individual to maintain allegiance to two contradictory truths while remaining unconscious of the contradiction. An extreme manifestation of dissociation is dissociative identity disorder, in which a person may exhibit several independent personalities, each unaware of the others.

*distractibility* Difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks; attention is easily diverted by extraneous stimuli; difficulty maintaining goal-focused behavior, including both planning and completing tasks. Distractibility is a facet of the broad personality trait domain DiSlNHlBmON.

Physical fatigue leads to an inability to continue functioning at one's normal level of activity. Although widespread in everyday life, this state usually becomes particularly noticeable during heavy exercise. Mental fatigue, by contrast, most often manifests as SOMNOLENCE (sleepiness).fear An emotional response to perceived imminent threat or danger associated with urges to flee or fight.

*flashback* A dissociative state during which aspects of a traumatic event are reexperienced as though they were occurring at that moment.

Hallucinations should be distinguished from ILLUSIONS, in which an actual external stimulus is misperceived or misinteφreted. The person may or may not have insight into the non- veridical nature of the hallucination. One hallucinating person may recognize the false sensory experience, whereas another may be convinced that the experience is grounded in reality. The term hallucination is not ordinarily applied to the false perceptions that occur during dreaming, while falling asleep (hypnagogic), or upon awakening (hypno- pompic). Transient hallucinatory experiences may occur without a mental disorder.

The most common tactile hallucinations are the sensationof electric shocks and formication (the sensation of something creeping or crawling on pr under the skin).visual A hallucination involving sight, which may consist of formed images, such as of people, or of unformed images, such as flashes of light. Visual hallucinations should be distinguished from ILLUSIONS, which are misperceptions of real external stimuli.

*hypervigilance* An enhanced state of sensory sensitivity accompanied by an exaggerated intensity of behaviors whose purpose is to detect threats. Hypervigilance is also accompanied by a state of increased anxiety which can cause exhaustion. Other symptoms include abnormally increased arousal, a high responsiveness to stimuli, and a continual scanning of the environment for threats. In hypervigilance, there is a perpetual scanning of the environment to search for sights, sounds, people, behaviors, smells, or anything else that is reminiscent of threat or trauma. The individual is placed on high alert in order to be certain danger is not near. Hypervigilance can lead to a variety of obsessive behavior patterns, as well as producing difficulties with social interaction and relationships.

*hypomania* An abnormality of mood resembling mania but of lesser intensity. See also MANIA.

*hypopnea* Episodes of overly shallow breathing or an abnormally low respiratory rate.

*impulsivity* Acting on the spur of the moment in response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing and following plans; a sense of urgency and self-harming behavior under emotional distress. Impulsivity is a facet of the broad personality trait domain DiSlNHlBmON.

*incoherence* Speech or thinking that is essentially incomprehensible to others because word or phrases are joined together without a logical or meaningful connection. This disturbance occurs within clauses, in contrast to derailment, in which the disturbance is between clauses. This has sometimes been referred to a "word salad" to convey the degree of linguistic disorganization. Mildly ungrammatical constructions or idiomatic usages characteristic of a particular regional or cultural backgrounds, lack of education, or low intelligence should not be considered incoherence. The term is generally not applied when there is evidence that the disturbance in speech is due to an aphasia.

*melancholia* (melancholic) A mental state characterized by very severe depression.

*micropsia* The visual perception that objects are smaller than they actually are. Compare with MACROPSIA.

*mixed symptoms* The specifier "with mixed features" is applied to mood episodes during which subthreshold symptoms from the opposing pole are present. Whereas these concurrent "mixed" symptoms are relatively simultaneous, they may also occur closely juxtaposed in time as a waxing and waning of individual symptoms of the opposite pole (i.

*e* ., depressive symptoms during hypomanic or manic episodes, and vice versa).mood A pervasive and sustained emotion that colors the perception of the world. Common examples of mood include depression, elation, anger, and anxiety. In contrast to affect, which refers to more fluctuating changes in emotional "weather", mood refers to a pervasive and sustained emotional "climate."

*irritable* Easily annoyed and provoked to anger.

*mood* -congruent psychotic features Delusions or hallucinations whose content is entirely consistent with the typical themes of a depressed or manic mood. If the mood is depressed, the content of the delusions or hallucinations would involve themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment. The content of the delusion may include themes of persecution if these are based on self-derogatory concepts such as deserved punishment. If the mood is manic, the content of the delusions or hallucinations would involve themes of inflated worth, power, knowledge, or identity, or a special relationship to a deity or a famous person. The content of the delusion may include themes of persecution if these are based on concepts such as inflated worth or deserved punishment.

*mood* -incongruent psychotic features Delusions or hallucinations whose content is not consistent with the typical themes of a depressed or manic mood. In the case of depression, the delusions or hallucinations would not involve themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment. In the case of mania, the delusions or hallucinations would not involve themes of inflated worth, power, knowledge, or identity, or a special relationship to a deity or a famous person.

*night eating syndrome* Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or excessive food consumption after the evening meal. There is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not better accounted for by external influences such as changes in the individual's sleep-wake cycle or by local social norms.

*nightmare disorder* Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and well- remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to survival, security or physical integrity and that generally occur during the second half of the major sleep episode. On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented and alert.

*nonsubstance addiction* (s) Behavioral disorder (also called behavioral addiction) not related to any substance of abuse that shares some features with substance-induced addiction.

*obsession* Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.

*e* ., by performing a compulsion).overeating Eating too much food too quickly.

*overvalued idea* An unreasonable and sustained belief that is maintained with less than delusional intensity (i.

During these attacks there are symptoms such as shortness of breath or smothering sensations; palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; chest pain or discomfort; choking; and fear of going crazy or losing control. Panic attacks may be unexpected, in which the onset of the attack is not associated with an obvious trigger and instead occurs "out of the blue", or expected, in which the panic attack is associated with an obvious trigger, either internal or external.

*paranoid ideation* Ideation, of less than delusional proportions, involving suspiciousness or the belief that one is being harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated.

*parasomnias* Disorders of sleep involving abnormal behaviors or physiological events occurring during sleep or sleep-wake transitions. Compare with DYSSOMNIAS.

*perseveration* Persistence at tasks or in particular way of doing things long after the behavior has ceased to be functional or effective; continuance of the same behavior despite repeated failures or clear reasons for stopping. Perseveration is a facet of the broad personality trait domain NEGATIVE Affectivity.

*personality* Enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself. PERSONALITY TRAITS are prominent aspects of personality that are exhibited in relatively consistent ways across time and across situations. Personality traits influence self and interpersonal functioning. Depending on their severity, impairments in personality functioning and personality trait expression may reflect the presence of a personality disorder.

*personality disorder* —trait specified In Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders", a proposed diagnostic category for use when a personality disorder is considered present but the criteria for a specific disorder are not met. Personality disorder—trait specified (PD-TS) is defined by significant impairment in personality functioning, as measured by the Level of Personality Functioning Scale and one or more pathological PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS or PERSONALITY TRAIT FACETS. PD-TS is proposed in DSM-5 Section III for further study as a possible future replacement for other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder.

*personality functioning* Cognitive models of self and others that shape patterns of emotional and affiliative engagement.

*personality trait* A tendency to behave, feel, perceive, and think in relatively consistent ways across time and across situations in which the trait may be manifest.

*pica* Persistent eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances over a period of at least 1 month.

The eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances is inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual (a minimum age of 2 years is suggested for diagnosis). The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice.

*polysomnography* Polysomnography (PSG), also known as a sleep study, is a multipa- rametric test used in the study of sleep and as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. The test result is called a polysomnogram, also abbreviated PSG. PSG monitors many body functions, including brain (electroencephalography), eye movements (electro-oculography), muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation (electromyography), and heart rhythm (electrocardiography).posturing Spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity (as seen in catatonia). Abnormal posturing may also be a sign of certain injuries to the brain or spinal cord, including the following:decerebrate posture The arms and legs are out straight and rigid, the toes point downward, and the head is arched backward.

## Concepts of Distréii

## Ataque de nervios

Ataque de nervios ("attack of nerves") is a syndrome among individuals of Latino descent, characterized by symptoms of intense emotional upset, including acute anxiety, anger, or grief; screaming and shouting uncontrollably; attach of crying; trembling; heat in the chest rising into the head; and becoming verbally and physically aggressive. Dissociative experiences (e.

*g* ., depersonalization, derealization, amnesia), seizure-like or fainting episodes, and suicidal gestures are prominent in some ataques but absent in others. A general feature of an ataque de nervios is a sense of being out of control. Attacks frequently occur as a direct result of a stressful event relating to the family, such as news of the death of a close relative, conflicts with a spouse or children, or witnessing an accident involving a family member. For a minority of individuals, no particular social event triggers their ataques; instead, their vulnerability to losing control comes from the accumulated experience of suffering.

No one-to-one relationship has been found between ataque and any specific psychiatric disorder, although several disorders, including panic disorder, other specified or unspecified dissociative disorder, and conversion disorder, have symptomatic overlap with ataque.

In community samples, ataque is associated with suicidal ideation, disability, and outpatient psychiatric utilization, after adjustment for psychiatric diagnoses, traumatic exposure, and other covariates. However, some ataques represent normative expressions of acute distress (e.

*g* ., at a funeral) without clinical sequelae. The term ataque de nervios may also refer to an idiom of distress that includes any "fit"-like paroxysm of emotionality (e.

*g* ., hysterical laughing) and may be used to indicate an episode of loss of control in response to an intense stressor.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Indisposition in Haiti, blacking out in the Southern United States, and falling out in the West Indies.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Panic attack, panic disorder, other specified or unspecified dissociative disorder, conversion (functional neurologic symptom) disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder, other specified or unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder.

## Dhat syndrome

Dhat syndrome is a term that was coined in South Asia little more than half a century ago to account for common clinical presentations of young male patients who attributed their various symptoms to semen loss. Despite the name, it is not a discrete syndrome but rather a cultural explanation of distress for patients who refer to diverse symptoms, such as anxiety, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, impotence, other multiple somatic complaints, and depressive mood. The cardinal feature is anxiety and distress about the loss of dhat in the absence of any identifiable physiological dysfunction. Dhat was identified by patients as a white discharge that was noted on defecation or urination. Ideas about this substance are related to the concept of dhatu (semen) described in the Hindu system of medicine, Ayurveda, as one of seven essential bodily fluids whose balance is necessary to maintain health.

Although dhat syndrome was formulated as a cultural guide to local clinical practice, related ideas about the harmful effects of semen loss have been shown to be widespread in the general population, suggesting a cultural disposition for explaining health problems and symptoms with reference to dhat syndrome. Research in health care settings has yielded diverse estimates of the syndrome's prevalence (e.

*g* ., 64% of men attending psychiatric clinics in India for sexual complaints; 30% of men attending general medical clinics in Pakistan). Although dhat syndrome is most commonly identified with young men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, middle-aged men may also be affected. Comparable concerns about white vaginal discharge (leu- korrhea) have been associated with a variant of the concept for women.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: koro in Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore and shen-k'uei ("kidney deficiency") in China.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, erectile disorder, early (premature) ejaculation, other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction, academic problem.

Khyâl cap"Khyal attacks" (khyâl cap), or "wind attacks", is a syndrome found among Cambodians in the United States and Cambodia. Common symptoms include those of panic attacks, such as dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, and cold extremities, as well as other symptoms of anxiety and autonomic arousal (e.

*g* ., tinnitus and neck soreness). Khyâl attacks include catastrophic cognitions centered on the concern that khyâl (a windlike substance) may rise in the body—along with blood—and cause a range of serious effects (e.

*g* ., compressing the lungs to cause shortness of breath and asphyxia; entering the cranium to cause tinnitus, dizziness, blurry vision, and a fatal syncope). Khyâl attacks may occur without warning, but are frequently brought about by triggers such as worrisome thoughts, standing up (i.

*e* ., orthostasis), specific odors with negative associations, and agoraphobic- type cues like going to crowded spaces or riding in a car. Khyâl attacks usually meet panic attack criteria and may shape the experience of other anxiety and trauma- and stressor- related disorders. Khyâl attacks may be associated with considerable disability.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Laos (pen lom), Tibet (srog rlunggi nad), Sri Lanka (vata), and Korea (hwa byung).

Related conditions in DSM-5: Panic attack, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, illness anxiety disorder.

## Kufungisisa

Kufungisisa ("thinking too much" in Shona) is an idiom of distress and a cultural explanation among the Shona of Zimbabwe. As an explanation, it is considered to be causative of anxiety, depression, and somatic problems (e.

*g* ., "my heart is painful because I think too much"). As an idiom of psychosocial distress, it is indicative of interpersonal and social difficulties (e.

*g* ., marital problems, having no money to take care of children). Kufungisisa involves ruminating on upsetting thoughts, particularly worries.

Kufungisisa is associated with a range of psychopathology, including anxiety symptoms, excessive worry, panic attacks, depressive symptoms, and irritability. In a study of a random community sample, two-thirds of the cases identified by a general psychopathology measure were of this complaint.

In many cultures, "thinking too much" is considered to be damaging to the mind and body and to cause specific symptoms like headache and dizziness. "Thinking too much" may also be a key component of cultural syndromes such as "brain fag" in Nigeria. In the case of brain fag, "thinking too much" is primarily attributed to excessive study, which is considered to damage the brain in particular, with symptoms including feelings of heat or crawling sensations in the head.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: "'Thinking too much" is a common idiom of distress ^nd cultural explanation across many countries and ethnic groups. It has been described in Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America, and among East Asian and Native American groups.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, persistent complex bereavement disorder (see "Conditions for Further Study").

## Maladi moun

Maladi moun (literally "humanly caused illness", also referred to as "sent sickness") is a cultural explanation in Haitian communities for diverse medical and psychiatric disorders. In this explanatory model, interpersonal envy and malice cause people to harm their enemies by sending illnesses such as psychosis, depression, social or academic failure, and inability to perform activities of daily living. The etiological model assumes that illness may be caused by others' envy and hatred, provoked by the victim's economic success as evidenced by a new job or expensive purchase. One person's gain is assumed to produce another person's loss, so visible success makes one vulnerable to attack. Assigning the label of sent sickness depends on mode of onset and social status more than presenting symptoms. The acute onset of new symptoms or an abrupt behavioral change raises suspicions of a spiritual attack. Someone who is attractive, intelligent, or wealthy is perceived as especially vulnerable, and even young healthy children are at risk.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Concerns about illness (typically, physical illness) caused by envy or social conflict are common across cultures and often expressed in the form of "evil eye" (e.

*g* . in Spanish, mal de ojo, in Italian, mal'occhiu).

Related conditions in DSM-5: Delusional disorder, persecutory type; schizophrenia with paranoid features.

## Nervios

## Nervios ("nerves") is a common idiom of distress among Latinos in the United States and

Latin America. Nervios refers to a general state of vulnerability to stressful life experiences and to difficult life circumstances. The term nervios includes a wide range of symptoms of emotional distress, somatic disturbance, and inability to function. The most common symptoms attributed to nervios include headaches and "brain aches" (occipital neck tension), irritability, stomach disturbances, sleep difficulties, nervousness, easy tearfulness, inability to concentrate, trembling, tingling sensations, and mareos (dizziness with occasional vertigo-like exacerbations). Nervios is a broad idiom of distress that spans the range of severity from cases with no mental disorder to presentations resembling adjustment, anxiety, depressive, dissociative, somatic symptom, or psychotic disorders. "Being nervous since childhood" appears to be more of a trait and may precede social anxiety disorder, while "being ill with nerves" is more related than other forms of nervios to psychiatric problems, especially dissociation and depression.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Nevra among Greeks in North America, nierbi among Sicilians in North America, and nerves among whites in Appalachia and Newfoundland.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, peristent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, other specified or unspecified dissociative disorder, somatic symptom disorder, schizophrenia.

## Shenjing shuairuo

## Shenjing shuairuo ("weakness of the nervous system" in Mandarin Chinese) is a cultural syndrome that integrates conceptual categories of traditional Chinese medicine with the

Western diagnosis of neurasthenia. In the second, revised edition of the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-2-R), shenjing shuairuo is defined as a syndrome composed of three out of five nonhierarchical symptom clusters: weakness (e.

*g* ., mental fatigue), emotions (e.

*g* ., feeling vexed), excitement (e.

*g* ., increased recollections), nervous pain (e.

*g* ., headache), and sleep (e.

*g* ., insomnia). Fan nao (feeling vexed) is a form of irritability mixed with worry and distress over conflicting thoughts and unfulfilled desires. The third edition of the CCMD retains shenjing shuairuo as a somatoform diagnosis of exclusion. Salient précipitants of shenjing shuairuo include work- or family-related stressors, loss of face {mianzi, lianzi), and an acute sense of failure (e.

*g* ., in academic performance). Shenjing shuairuo is related to traditional concepts of weakness (xu) and health imbalances related to deficiencies of a vital essence (e.

*g* ., the depletion of qi [vital energy] following overstraining or stagnation of qi due to excessive worry). In the traditional interpretation, shenjing shuairuo results when bodily channels (jing) conveying vital forces (shen) become dysregulated as a result of various social and interpersonal stressors, such as the inability to change a chronically frustrating and distressing situation. Various psychiatric disorders are associated with shenjing shuairuo, notably mood, anxiety, and somatic symptom disorders. In medical clinics in China, however, up to 45% of patients with shenjing shuairuo do not meet criteria for any DSM-IV disorder.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Neurasthenia-spectrum idioms and syndromes are present in India (ashaktapanna) and Japan (shinkei-suijaku), among other settings. Other conditions, such as brain fag syndrome, burnout syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome, are also closely related.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder.

## Susto

Susto ("fright") is a cultural explanation for distress and misfortune prevalent among some Latinos in the United States and among people in Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is not recognized as an illness category among Latinos from the Caribbean. Susto is an illness attributed to a frightening event that causes the soul to leave the body and results in unhappiness and sickness, as well as difficulties functioning in key social roles. Symptoms may appear any time from days to years after the fright is experienced. In extreme cases, susto may result in death. There are no specific defining symptoms for susto; however, symptoms that are often reported by people with susto include appetite disturbances, inadequate or excessive sleep, troubled sleep or dreams, feelings of sadness, low self-worth or dirtiness, interpersonal sensitivity, and lack of motivation to do anything. Somatic symptoms accompanying susto may include muscle aches and pains, cold in the extremities, pallor, headache, stomachache, and diarrhea. Precipitating events are diverse, and include natural phenomena, animals, interpersonal situations, and supernatural agents, among others.

Three syndromic types of susto (referred to as cibih in the local Zapotec language) have been identified, each having different relationships with psychiatric diagnoses. An interpersonal susto characterized by feelings of loss, abandonment, and not being loved by family, with accompanying symptoms of sadness, poor self-image, and suicidal ideation, seemed to be closely related to major depressive disorder. When susto resulted from a traumatic event that played a major role in shaping symptoms and in emotional processing of the experience, the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder appeared more appropriate. Susto characterized by various recurrent somatic symptoms—for which the person sought health care from several practitioners—was thought to resemble a somatic symptom disorder.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Similar etiological concepts and symptom configurations are found globally. In the Andean region, susto is referred to as espanto.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, other specified or unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder, somatic symptom disorders.

## Taijin kyofusho

Taijin kyofusho ("interpersonal fear disorder" in Japanese) is a cultural syndrome characterized by anxiety about and avoidance of interpersonal situations due to the thought, feeling, or conviction that one's appearance and actions in social interactions are inadequate or offensive to others. In the United States, the variant involves having an offensive body odor and is termed olfactory reference syndrome. Individuals with taijin kyofusho tend to focus on the impact of their symptoms and behaviors on others. Variants include major concerns about facial blushing (erythrophobia), having an offensive body odor (olfactory reference syndrome), inappropriate gaze (too much or too little eye contact), stiff or awkward facial expression or bodily movements (e.

*g* ., stiffening, trembling), or body deformity.

Taijin kyofusho is a broader construct than social anxiety disorder in DSM-5. In addition to performance anxiety, taijin kyofusho includes two culture-related forms: a "sensitive type", with extreme social sensitivity and anxiety about interpersonal interactions, and an "offensive type", in which the major concern is offending others. As a category, taijin kyofusho thus includes syndromes with features of body dysmorphic disorder as well as delusional disorder. Concerns may have a delusional quality, responding poorly to simple reassurance or counterexample.

The distinctive symptoms of taijin kyofusho occur in specific cultural contexts and, to some extent, with more severe social anxiety across cultures. Similar syndromes are found in Korea and other societies that place a strong emphasis on the self-conscious maintenance of appropriate social behavior in hierarchical interpersonal relationships. Taijin kyo- fushoAike symptoms have also been described in other cultural contexts, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Taein kong po in Korea.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Social anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, delusional disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, olfactory reference syndrome (a type of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder). Olfactory reference syndrome is related specifically to the jikoshu-kyofu variant of taijin kyofusho, whose core symptom is the concern that the person emits an offensive body odor. This presentation is seen in various cultures outside Japan.
